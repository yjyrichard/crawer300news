Amazonhas offered to cover the cost of college tuition of all 750,000 of its frontline workers in the US. It comes as the online shopping giant struggles to attract and retain staff amid an industry wide labor shortage. 电商巨头亚马逊宣布，将为工作在美国一线的所有75万名员工全额支付大学学费，从而在紧张的劳动力市场吸引和留住员工。 The firm said it would invest $1.2 billion in the plan, with workers able to access the annual funding for as long as they remain at Amazon. 亚马逊表示，将在这一资助项目中投入12亿美元(约合人民币77亿元)，只要员工留在亚马逊，就可以获得这项年度资助款。 It's the latest big firm to offer to fund workers' education after similar moves by Walmart and Target. 这是继沃尔玛和塔吉特之后，又一家宣布资助员工学费的大公司。 The shopping giant also said it would cover other types of education, including high school diplomas and English language courses, as well as extending on-the-job career training to 300,000. 亚马逊还表示，助学金将涵盖包括高中文凭和英语课程在内的其他教育项目，并计划将在职培训人数增加到30万人。 According to the US Labor Department, job openings hit a new record high of 10.9 million in July, surpassing the number of unemployed people by more than 2 million. 美国劳工部的数据显示，七月份的职位空缺数量达到了破纪录的1009万，比失业人数高出200多万。 Experts say a mixture of people leaving the workforce during the pandemic, lingering concerns about COVID-19 and a lack of childcare have prolonged the shortage. 专家指出，疫情期间各行各业都有人离开了劳动力队伍，对新冠疫情的担忧以及无人照顾小孩的现状让劳动力紧张的局势进一步持续。
